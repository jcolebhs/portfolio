               <h2>About Me</h2>
               <p>Hi, my name is Jeron Cole. I'm 16 years old and I live in Memphis, Tenneessee. I attend Bartlett High School.During my free time I'm eother playing video games, basketball, or doing something school rlated if I need to. I usually go to the gym three to four times a week.I also play on an AAU team at the moment.Hopefully, I learn enough to play next year for the school.</p>
               <p>It's going to be hard though . I have alot to learn before the end of the summer.I believe that it is possible for me to do though.Anothr thing I would like to do is improve my physical shape and get taller.Right now I'm in shape, but I know that their is always room for improvement. I would like to be six feet and three inches all the way up to six feet five inches. That's a reasonable athlete height in my opinion.Anyways, this is my portfolio website for my web design class. So, I am still new to this, but here you will see some of the websites I made this year in Web design.</p>

               <p>This was my first website that I created with a group earlier in the school year. Our goal was to make a restaurant website.Here is a link to the website.</p>

               <p>This project was about a dog that we choose in class. I tried to make it as simple as possible.This was before the end of my first semeter in my Web Design class.</p>

             <p>Our last project was the making of a page that describes an extinct animal. We were to give information and simple facts about them while using correct CSS..</p>
